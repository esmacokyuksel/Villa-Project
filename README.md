In my latest project, I developed a dynamic web application featuring a user-friendly interface and an effective admin panel. By utilizing .NET Core 7.0, MongoDB, and Entity Framework, I embraced modern software development practices.

Key Features of the Project
Admin Panel:
The admin panel allows administrators to update content, add and delete properties, and manage user messages. These features facilitate effective site control for administrators.

User Interface:
The homepage is designed to help users easily discover featured properties and quickly access the contact section, with a clean and effective design prioritizing user experience.

Technological Infrastructure
The technologies I used in my project include:

.NET Core 7.0: Enables rapid and efficient application development.
MongoDB: Provides the ability to manage large datasets with flexible data structures.
Entity Framework: Helps perform database operations simply and effectively.

This project delivers a comprehensive solution that meets the needs of both users and administrators. The development process focused on enhancing user experience and ensuring efficiency. I aim to further improve this experience with future updates.
